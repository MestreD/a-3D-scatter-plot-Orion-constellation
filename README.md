# a-3D-scatter-plot-Orion-constellation
In this project, I will play the part of an astrophysicist who has the job of visualizing constellation data for the Hayden Planetarium in NYC. Iâ€™ll use Matplotlib to programmatically visualize both 2D and 3D charts, including a 3D scatter plot that maps the x, y, and z coordinates of the Orion constellation.
